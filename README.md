# Spray-Drying-Project

# Abstract
<p>
Food supply and consumption have contributed to climate change and environmental crisis, so a change in consumption habits is needed. Consumers are more particular in food products that provide additional health benefits, such as plant-based substitutes. Process optimization is essential for the food processing industry to increase yield while cutting down on industrial waste and cost. Dehydration is used to reduce moisture content in food products, and spray drying is a food preservation technique. Forecasting output parameters such as product yield and moisture content is needed to optimize spray drying processes.
